# Standard fissile job to handle post-start scripts.  Currently the
# start command does its own dependency checking to work around issues
# in monit. When we reach use of monit 5.15+ the dependency
# information can shift out of the script to this job. It makes the
# job dynamic however, i.e. it will then have to be created and added
# by run.sh (As a post-start.monitrc file in the standard place).
