## fissile build images

Builds Docker images from your BOSH releases.

### Synopsis



This command goes through all the role definitions in the role manifest creating a
Dockerfile for each of them and building it.

Each role gets a directory `<work-dir>/dockerfiles`. In each directory one can find
a Dockerfile and a directory structure that gets ADDed to the docker image. The
directory structure contains jobs, packages and all other necessary scripts and
templates.

The images will have a 'role' label useful for filtering.
The entrypoint for each image is `/opt/scf/run.sh`.

The images will be tagged: `<repository>-<role_name>:<SIGNATURE>`.
The SIGNATURE is based on the hashes of all jobs and packages that are included in
the image.

The `--patch-properties-release` flag is used to distinguish the patchProperties release/job spec
from other specs.  At most one is allowed.
